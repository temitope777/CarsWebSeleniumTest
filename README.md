This code uses Java and Selenium to test the https://cartaxcheck.co.uk/ website
There is an issue with CAPTCHA stopping the navigation so it
was practically impossible to properly complete even though
I scraped the website and tested locally but couldnt test 
end to end due to that
However, I believe that it demonstrates enough the understanding
which I believe is what you want to acieve

There are many more ways to improve the test suite which I 
couldnt get to including using Ghenkins, features,
dependency injection, interfaces and so on but couldnt get further due 
to time constraints
